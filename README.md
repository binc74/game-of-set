# Project 2
### Game of Set

### **Important*
* In this project, the Gosu gem is used for the graphics, so this gem needs to be installed to run this program
    * For Windows, install Gosu by typing this command ```gem install gosu```
    * For Linux, here are the commands to install the Gosu gem
    ```
    # Dependencies for both C++ and Ruby
    sudo apt-get install build-essential libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libpango1.0-dev \
                         libgl1-mesa-dev libopenal-dev libsndfile-dev libmpg123-dev \
                         libgmp-dev
    
    # To install Ruby itself - if you are using rvm or rbenv, please skip this step
    sudo apt-get install ruby-dev
    
    # If you are using a Ruby version manager (i.e. rvm or rbenv)
    gem install gosu
    # If you are using system Ruby, you will need "sudo" to install Ruby libraries (gems)
    sudo gem install gosu
    ```

* One of our members, Josh, have some important things to deal with so he is out of town in the second week, 
so he might not be pushing often in the second week. But instead, he contributed a huge amount of work in the first week,
so I think the work balance is fine
